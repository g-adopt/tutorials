    "Rayleigh-Taylor instability\n",
    "===========================\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "One may wish to simulate a geodynamical flow involving multiple physical phases. A\n",
    "possible approach is to approximate phases as immiscible and forming a single fluid\n",
    "whose dynamics can still be described as a single-phase Stokes flow. Under this\n",
    "approximation, it is common to refer to immiscible phases as materials and to the\n",
    "resulting simulations as multi-material. In such simulations, each material occupies\n",
    "part of the numerical domain and is characterised by its own physical properties,\n",
    "such as density and viscosity. Along material boundaries, physical properties are\n",
    "averaged according to a chosen mathematical scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical approach\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "To model the coexistence of multiple materials in the numerical domain, we employ an\n",
    "interface-capturing approach called the conservative level-set method. Level-set\n",
    "methods associate each material interface to a mathematical field representing a\n",
    "measure of distance from that interface. In the conservative level-set approach, the\n",
    "classic signed-distance function, $\\phi$, employed in the level-set method is\n",
    "transformed into a smooth step function, $\\psi$, according to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[\n",
    "\\mathrm{tanh} \\left( \\frac{\\phi(\\mathbf{x}, t)}{2\\epsilon} \\right) + 1\n",
    "\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the simulation, the level-set field is advected with the flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\mathbf{u}\\psi \\right) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Advection of the level set modifies the shape of the initial profile. In other words,\n",
    "the signed-distance property underpinning the smooth step function is lost. To\n",
    "maintain the original profile as the simulation proceeds, a reinitialisation\n",
    "procedure is employed. We choose the equation proposed in [Parameswaran and Mandal\n",
    "(2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0997754622001364):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\tau_{n}} = \\theta \\left[\n",
    "-\\psi \\left( 1 - \\psi \\right) \\left( 1 - 2\\psi \\right)\n",
    "+ \\epsilon \\left( 1 - 2\\psi \\right) \\lvert\\nabla\\psi\\rvert\n",
    "\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This example\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we consider the isoviscous Rayleigh-Taylor instability presented in [van Keken\n",
    "et al. (1997)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/97JB01353).\n",
    "Inside a 2-D domain, a buoyant, lighter material sits beneath a denser material. The\n",
    "initial material interface promotes the development of a rising instability on the\n",
    "domain's left-hand side, and further smaller-scale convective dynamics take place\n",
    "throughout the remainder of the simulation. We describe below how to implement this\n",
    "problem using G-ADOPT."
