Indeed, aside from the viscosity and reference Rayleigh Number ($Ra_{0}=10^2$), all other aspects of this case are identical to the case presented above. \n",
    "\n",
    "The viscosity field, $\\mu$, is calculated as the harmonic mean between a linear component, $\\mu_{\\text{lin}}$ (dependent on depth and temperature) and a nonlinear, plastic component, $\\mu_{\\text{plast}}$, which is dependent on the second invariant of the strain-rate, as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu(T,z,\\dot \\epsilon) = 2 \\Biggl(\\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\text{lin}(T,z)}} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\text{plast}(\\dot\\epsilon)}} \\Biggr)^{-1}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The linear part is given by an Arrhenius law (the so-called Frank-Kamenetskii approximation):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_{\\text{lin}(T,z)} = \\exp(-\\gamma_{T}T + \\gamma_{z}z),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\gamma_{T}=\\ln(\\Delta\\mu_T)$ and $\\gamma_{z}=\\ln(\\Delta\\mu_z)$ are parameters controlling the total viscosity contrast due to temperature and depth, respectively. The nonlinear component is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_{\\text{plast}}(\\dot\\epsilon) = \\mu^{\\star} + \\frac{\\sigma_{y}}{\\sqrt{\\dot\\epsilon : \\dot\\epsilon}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mu^\\star$ is a constant representing the effective viscosity at high stresses and $\\sigma_{y}$ is the yield stress. The denominator of the second term represents the second invariant of the strain-rate tensor. The viscoplastic flow law leads to linear viscous deformation at low stresses and plastic deformation at stresses that exceed $\\sigma_{y}$, with the decrease in viscosity limited by the choice of $\\mu^\\star$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although Tosi et al. (2015) examined a number of cases, we focus on one here (Case 4: $Ra_{0}=10^2$, $\\Delta\\mu_T=10^5$, $\\Delta\\mu_{y}=10$ and $\\mu^{\\star}=10^{-3}$), which allows us to demonstrate how a temperature-, depth- and strain-rate dependent viscosity is incorporated within Firedrake. The changes required to simulate this case, relative to our base case are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear solver options are no longer applicable, given the dependence of viscosity on the flow field, through the strain-rate. Accordingly, the solver dictionary is updated to account for the nonlinear nature of our Stokes system. We exploit the SNES, using a setup based on Newton's method (`snes_type: newtonls`) with a secant line search over the L2-norm of the function (`snes_linesearch_type: l2`). As we target a steady-state solution, an absolute tolerance is specified for our nonlinear solver (`snes_atol: 1e-10`).\n",
    "2. Solver options differ between the (nonlinear) Stokes and (linear) energy systems. As such, a separate solver dictionary is specified for solution of the energy equation. Consistent with our base case, we use a direct solver for solution of the energy equation, based on the MUMPS library. Both of these changes are shown below. "
