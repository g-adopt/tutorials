# Compressible (TALA) 2-D mantle convection problem in a square box
# =======================================================
#
# It is common practice within the geodynamical modelling community to
# neglect dynamic pressure's effect on buoyancy terms in the force-balance equation, under the
# so-called Truncated Anelastic Liquid Approximation (TALA). Our previous tutorial,
# which examined convection under the Anelastic Liquid Approximation (ALA),
# can be easily modified to take this change into account, as we demonstrate here.
#
# This example
# ------------
#
# In this example, we simulate compressible convection, for an isoviscous material,
# under TALA. We specify $Ra=10^5$ and a dissipation number $Di=0.5$.
# The model is heated from below $ T = 1.0 - (T0*\mbox{exp}(Di) - T0)$, cooled from the top (T=0)
# in an enclosed 2-D Cartesian box (i.e. free-slip mechanical boundary
# conditions on all boundaries).
#
# As with all examples, the first step is to import the gadopt module, which
# provides access to Firedrake and associated functionality.

try:
    from gadopt import *
except ImportError:
    !wget "https://fem-on-colab.github.io/releases/firedrake-install-real.sh" -O "/tmp/firedrake-install.sh" && bash "/tmp/firedrake-install.sh"

# We next set up the mesh, function spaces, and specify functions to hold our solutions,
# identically to our previous tutorials.

nx, ny = 40, 40  # Number of cells in x and y directions.
mesh = UnitSquareMesh(nx, ny, quadrilateral=True)  # Square mesh generated via firedrake
mesh.cartesian = True

V = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 2)  # Velocity function space (vector)

# We next specify the important constants for this problem, including those associated with the
# compressible reference state. Note that for ease of extension, we specify these as functions,
# allowing for spatial variability. Given that we neglect the effect of dynamic pressure on
# buoyancy in this example, we do not need to specify the bulk modulus (chibar).

X = SpatialCoordinate(mesh)
Ra = Constant(1e5)  # Rayleigh number
Di = Constant(0.5)  # Dissipation number

cpbar = Function(Q, name="IsobaricSpecificHeatCapacity").assign(1.0)  # Specific heat capacity
gbar = Function(Q, name="GravitationalAcceleration").assign(1.0)  # radial gravity

# These fields are used to set up our Truncated Anelastic Liquid Approximation. Alongside dropping the
# requirement for specifying the bulk modulus, this is the key change relative to our tutorial under the ALA approximation.

# As with the previous examples, we next set up a *Timestep Adaptor*,
# for controlling the time-step length (via a CFL
# criterion) as the simulation advances in time. For the latter,
# we specify the initial time, initial timestep $\Delta t$, and number of
# timesteps. Given the low Ra, a steady-state tolerance is also specified,
# allowing the simulation to exit when a steady-state has been achieved.
# The steady-state tolerance specified here is tight, and can be increased
# to speed up the simulation, as required.

# We next set up and initialise our Temperature field. Note that here, we take into consideration
# the non-dimensional surface temperature, T0. The full temperature field is also initialised.
