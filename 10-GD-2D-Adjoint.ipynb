    "### Concept of taping:\n",
    "In <emp> automatic differentiation (AD)</emp>, \"taping\" is a technique used to record the operations performed during a forward pass through a computational graph, so that these operations can later be revisited in reverse order during the backward pass to compute gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, a \"tape\" is a data structure that keeps track of the sequence of operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) and the intermediate variables (often called \"tensors\" in machine learning contexts) that are created during the forward pass of an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Taping?\n",
    "Automatic differentiation relies on the chain rule of calculus to compute derivatives. In a forward pass, you compute the function value $f(x)$ as well as intermediate values needed to evaluate $f$. During the backward pass, you use these recorded operations and intermediate values to efficiently compute the gradient $\\nabla f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Does Taping Work in Automatic Differentiation?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialise an empty \"tape\" data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Forward Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each operation $\\text{op}$ in the computational graph:\n",
    "  - Record the input variables to $\\text{op}$ and the output variable from $\\text{op}$.\n",
    "  - Append this information to the tape.\n",
    "- Calculate and store the function value $f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tape might look something like this for a simple function $f(x, y) = x \\times y + \\sin(x)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "[(\\text{op: '*'}, \\text{inputs: [x, y]}, \\text{output: z1}), \\\\\n",
    " (\\text{op: 'sin'}, \\text{inputs: [x]}, \\text{output: z2}), \\\\\n",
    " (\\text{op: '+'}, \\text{inputs: [z1, z2]}, \\text{output: f})]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Backward Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize gradients for the output as $\\nabla f = 1$ (since $\\frac{df}{df} = 1$).\n",
    "- Traverse the tape in reverse order to:\n",
    "  - Retrieve the recorded operation $\\text{op}$ and involved variables.\n",
    "  - Use the chain rule to compute the local gradient contribution from the output variable to the input variables.\n",
    "  - Accumulate these local gradients into the global gradients of the involved variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through taping, AD libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch enable the efficient computation of gradients, which is essential for optimization tasks such as training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing $\\frac{df}{dx}$ Through Backward Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "In the backward pass, we initialize the gradient of the function $ f $ as $ \\nabla f = 1 $ (since $ \\frac{df}{df} = 1 $) and then perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute Local Gradients**\n",
    "    - $ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_1} = 1$ \n",
    "    - $ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_2} = 1$ \n",
    "    - $ \\frac{\\partial z_1}{\\partial x} = y$ \n",
    "    - $ \\frac{\\partial z_2}{\\partial x} = \\cos(x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Chain Rule to Compute Global Gradients**\n",
    "    - $ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_1} \\times \\frac{\\partial z_1}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_2} \\times \\frac{\\partial z_2}{\\partial x} $\n",
    "    - $ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 1 \\times y + 1 \\times \\cos(x) $\n",
    "    - $ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = y + \\cos(x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "And there you have itâ€”$ \\frac{df}{dx} $ is calculated to be $ y + \\cos(x) $ using the backward pass in automatic differentiation.\n",

    "In PDE (Partial Differential Equation) constrained optimization problems, two crucial concepts are the \"reduced functional\" and \"control\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reduced Functional\n",
    "\n",
    "A functional is a mapping from a function space to the real numbers. It often represents a quantity of interest that we aim to optimize. In PDE-constrained optimization, the functional typically depends on both the state variable $ u $ (which satisfies the PDE) and the control variable $ m $. It can be symbolized as $ J(u, m) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for a given control $ m $, the state variable $ u $ can be determined by solving the PDE. Therefore, $ J(u, m) $ can be expressed solely in terms of $ m $ by solving the PDE for $ u $ and substituting this solution into $ J $. This newly formed functional, $\\tilde{J}(m)$, is known as the \"reduced functional\". It encapsulates the optimization problem, eliminating the need to explicitly consider the state variable. Formally,\n",

    "### Control\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of PDE-constrained optimisation, the \"control\" refers to the parameters or variables that we can adjust to optimise the functional $J(u, m)$. Controls can manifest in various forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Boundary Conditions**: For instance, the temperature at the boundary in a heat transfer problem.\n",
    "2. **Source Terms**: Such as a heat source in a thermal challenge.\n",

This term's convergence rate of $O(h^2)$ serves as a strong foundation for verifying any computational implementation meant for determining $\\frac{d J}{d T_{IC}}$ (the adjoint code) with respect to a specific functional that computes $J(T_{IC})$ (the forward code). Given any arbitrary selection of $h$ and $\\delta T_{IC}$, halving the value of $h$ should decrease the magnitude of the second-order Taylor remainder by a factor of 4. Grounded in this theoretical prediction, we employ these so-called *Taylor tests* to confirm the accuracy of the determined gradients.\n",
