    "Idealised 2-D mantle convection with a free surface\n",
    "=======================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we show how to include a free surface boundary condition\n",
    "by modifying the 2-D case presented in our first tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Free Surface\n",
    "------------\n",
    "In the base case and other tutorials so far we have assumed that the top surface of the model is free-slip, i.e. the flow is free to move tangentially, but there is no normal flow across the top surface of the model. For a free surface we relax that condition so that the surface is able to deform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the boundary conditions for a free surface can be written as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\textbf{u} \\cdot \\textbf{n}  = \\dfrac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t}  \\textbf{n}  \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\hat{r}},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "      \\textbf{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}  = \\textbf{0},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\textbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, $\\textbf{n}$ is the unit normal, $\\eta$ is the free surface height, $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{r}}$ is the radial unit vector and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the full stress tensor. The first equation states that the velocity of the free surface is just the normal velocity at the surface and the second equation states there is no stress acting at the free surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to implement the zero stress condition at the free surface is just to move the mesh based on the velocity calculated in the domain. This is a Lagrangian formulation.  There are a few downsides to this. Firstly, it can be expensive to continually update the mesh geometry at each timestep. We also have to reformulate our equations in terms of a moving reference frame accounting for the mesh velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we subtract off the hydrostatic pressure from the full stress tensor and define this as $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma }'$, then the new stress boundary condition becomes\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "      \\textbf{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma }' \\cdot \\textbf{n}  = - \\Delta\\rho_{fs} g \\eta,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\Delta \\rho_{fs}$ is the density contrast across the free surface and $g$ is gravity. Provided that deviations in the free surface are small, we can linearise the effect of the free surface by just applying the additional stress at the reference level $z = z_0$, instead of at the top of the free surface $z = \\eta$. This means we can keep the mesh fixed in time and we do not have to change to a Lagrangian formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A possibly more important consideration though, is that if we couple the free surface to the Stokes equations explicitly in time, there will always be a lag between the interior dynamics pushing the free surface up and the stabilising feedback due to deviations of the free surface from the reference level. If we take timesteps that are too long then the simulation becomes unstable. This timestep limitation is based on a characteristic relaxation time scale\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\tau = \\dfrac{2 k \\mu}{\\Delta \\rho_{fs} g},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $k$ is a wavenumber, $\\mu$ is the viscosity, $\\Delta \\rho_{fs}$ is the density contrast across the free surface and $g$ is gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that long wavelengths decay fastest, so it is the longest waves that dictate the maximum stable timestep for an explicit free surface implementation. Usually, the timestep is controlled by an advection CFL condition calculated from the energy equation, however, a stable free surface timestep might be much lower than this estimate. This means that a free surface simulation with explicit timestepping may be an order of magnitude slower than an equivalent free-slip simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A way around this problem is to solve for the free surface height implicitly, i.e. at the same time as the velocity and pressure during the Stokes solve. By coupling the solution of velocity, pressure and the free surface together, there is no longer a timestep constraint. The decay of the (long) wavelengths with decay times shorter than the timestep are effectively damped by numerical diffusion. The upshot is we can take longer timesteps, so the simulation time is similar to a free-slip simulation, whilst being able to investigate time dependent short wavelength changes of the free surface. We have implemented the second order $\\theta$ timestepping method from Kramer et al. (2012) and we point the reader to this paper for a longer discussion of the different approaches and their implementation.\n",
