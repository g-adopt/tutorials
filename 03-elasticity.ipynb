    "Having studied a few scalar-valued problems, we now move on to a vector-valued problem.  The equations of linear elasticity.  Here, we'll treat the isotropic case.\n",

    "For small deformations, the governing equation is:\n",

    "$$ -\\nabla \\cdot \\sigma = f \\text{ in } \\Omega, $$\n",

    "\\text{and the symmetric strain tensor}\\quad   \\epsilon := \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla u + (\\nabla u)^T\\right), $$\n",
    "where $u$ is the unknown vector displacement field, and $\\mu$ and $\\lambda$ are the Lam√® parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, the variational formulation consists of multiplying by a test function in some suitable finite element space, $v \\in V$, and integrating.  Note that this time, the solution $u$, and hence the test space $V$ are *vector*-valued (so multiplication actually means taking the inner product).\n",
    "\n",
    "We obtain\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ -\\int_\\Omega (\\nabla \\cdot \\sigma)\\cdot v\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_\\Omega f \\cdot v\\,\\mathrm{d}x. $$\n",

    "\n",
    "We also need to specify boundary conditions.  We can do so either by prescribing the displacement $u$ on the boundary, or the *traction* $\\sigma \\cdot n$.  The former is a *strong* or *Dirichlet* condition, the latter a *weak* or *Neumann* condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us decide on a concrete setting.  We will solve for the displacement of a beam under its own weight clamped at one end.  That is, we will take $\\Omega = [0, L] \\times [0, W]$, we set $u = (0, 0)$ on $\\Gamma_D$, the plane $x = 0$.  On all other boundaries, we have traction-free conditions."
